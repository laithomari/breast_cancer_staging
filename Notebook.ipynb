PR is positive in 60% of tumor cell nuclei which is considered moderately positive. Since HER2/neu over expression is negative, score (1+), the HER2 status is negative.\\n\\nThere is no evidence of distant metastasis, so the M stage is M0.\\n\\nTherefore, based on the provided information, the pathological TNM stage would be T2pNxpM0.

CONSULTATION/CASE REVIEW/DISTRIBUTION INFORMATION:       Original Lab/Hospital:       MedLabs    Fax:4613032       Received 1 paraffin block and 1 stained slide labeled 3385 with      corresponding pathology report.             TISSUE ORIGIN:       Right breast mass.                   DIAGNOSIS:            RIGHT BREAST MASS; TRU-CUT BIOPSY:            Invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 2. See note.             NOTE:            Ductal carcinoma in situ, intermediate grade, solid and cribriform      patterns.  Lymphovascular invasion identified.  The tumor cells are     positive for E-Cadherin immunostain.  Estrogen receptors: Positive,     strong, in 95% of invasive tumor cell nuclei.  Progesterone receptors:     Positive, strong, in 90% of invasive tumor cell nuclei.  HER-2/neu     over expression: Negative, Score (1+).             Immunohistochemical stains for HER2 and estrogen/progesterone     receptors were performed on formalin fixed paraffin embedded sections     using automated immunostaining method (LSAB). Specimens subject to     these tests should be fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for at     least 6 hours, up to a maximum of 48 hours for HER2 testing and 72     hours for estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor testing (except     for paraffin blocks received from outside, for which the fixation time     cannot be determined). The volume of formalin should be at least 10     times the volume of the specimen. Antibody clones: Estrogen receptors:     SP1. Progesterone receptors: 1E2. HER-2/neu: Rabbit monoclonal (4B5)     (Ventana). Estrogen and progesterone receptors are reported by     assessing the percentage of tumor cells showing positive nuclear     staining, in addition to staining intensity (weak, moderate, strong).     For estrogen and progesterone receptors, any staining of 1% or more is     considered positive. HER-2 results are reported according to the     ASCO/CAP reporting guidelines (Wolff et al, Journal of Clinical     Oncology 2013): Score 0: No staining is observed or membrane staining     that is incomplete and is faint/barely perceptible and within . 10% of     tumor cells. Score 1: Incomplete membrane staining that is     faint/barely perceptible and within > 10% of tumor cells. Score 2:     Circumferential membrane staining that is incomplete and/or     weak/moderate and within > 10% of tumor cells or complete and      circumferential membrane staining that is intense and within . 10% of      tumor cells.
